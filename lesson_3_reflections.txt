When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work with other engineers or work using multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    By doing pull manualy, we can work on the same codes in parallel.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork copies someone's repository on my GitHub, but clone copies a repository
    to my local machine. Branches is a modified version of repository at some point.
    We use fork when we want to push some changes to the original and use clone
    when we just want to work on a copy.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
